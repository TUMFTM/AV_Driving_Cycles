## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
  
### Prerequisites

- Control System Toolbox,
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox,
- Simulink,
- Simulink Real-Time,
- Stateflow
  
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
Say what the step will be
  
```
Give the example
```
  
And repeat
  
```
until finished
```
  
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
  
## Running the Model/Code
Explain how to run the code
  
```
Give an example
```
  
## Deployment
